Generative AI Concepts and Interview Preparation Guide

1. FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

Machine Learning Fundamentals:
- Supervised Learning: Training with labeled data (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and rewards

Deep Learning:
- Neural Networks: Interconnected nodes that process information
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data
- Transformers: Attention-based architectures for sequence processing

2. GENERATIVE AI TECHNIQUES

Text Generation:
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models
- BERT and other encoder-only models
- T5 and BART (encoder-decoder architectures)

Image Generation:
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

Multimodal Models:
- CLIP: Connects text and images
- DALL-E: Text-to-image generation
- GPT-4V: Vision-language models

3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

What is RAG?
RAG combines retrieval systems with generative models to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Instead of relying solely on trained knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers.

Key Components:
- Document Ingestion: Processing and chunking documents
- Vector Embeddings: Converting text to numerical representations
- Vector Database: Storing and searching embeddings efficiently
- Retrieval: Finding relevant documents for a query
- Generation: Using retrieved context to generate answers

Popular RAG Frameworks:
- LangChain: Python framework for building LLM applications
- LlamaIndex: Data framework for LLM applications
- Haystack: Open-source framework for building search systems

4. PROMPT ENGINEERING

Techniques:
- Zero-shot prompting: Direct instructions without examples
- Few-shot prompting: Providing examples in the prompt
- Chain-of-thought: Breaking down reasoning step-by-step
- Self-consistency: Generating multiple responses and selecting the best

Best Practices:
- Be specific and clear
- Provide context when needed
- Use delimiters to separate sections
- Specify output format
- Give the model time to think

5. MODEL EVALUATION AND METRICS

Text Generation Metrics:
- BLEU: Measures n-gram overlap with reference text
- ROUGE: Recall-oriented metric for summarization
- Perplexity: Measures how well the model predicts text

RAG-Specific Metrics:
- Context Relevance: How relevant retrieved documents are to the query
- Answer Faithfulness: How well the answer matches the retrieved context
- Answer Relevance: How well the answer addresses the question

6. DEPLOYMENT AND SCALING

Model Optimization:
- Quantization: Reducing model precision for faster inference
- Distillation: Training smaller models to mimic larger ones
- Pruning: Removing unnecessary parameters

Infrastructure:
- GPU/TPU utilization
- Model serving with FastAPI, Flask
- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes

7. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Bias and Fairness:
- Data bias detection and mitigation
- Fair representation in training data
- Bias evaluation metrics

Safety and Alignment:
- Content filtering and moderation
- Fact-checking and hallucination detection
- Alignment with human values
